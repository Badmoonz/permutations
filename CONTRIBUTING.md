# Contributing

I emphatically welcome bug reports, issues you may encounter, documentation, and
pull requests. Feature requests may or may not get a response, though you can
always open a PR to add a feature you'd like.

## Getting started

If you'd like ideas for ways to contribute, check out `TODO.md`. Feel free to
open a PR or an issue if you want guidance on how to implement something. If
you're new to Idris, I can provide help to the best of my abilities.

## Rules etc.
We follow the [rust standards of
conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html), with the addendum that
we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment
regardless of sex worker status or previous sex worker status.

In addition, please be aware that not everyone speaks English as a first
language.
