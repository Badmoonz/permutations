# permutations

This is a library providing a type-safe implementation of permutations. It
builds on Alyssa Carter's code
[here](https://github.com/trillioneyes/idris-toys/blob/master/Permutation.idr)
as well as a similar [Haskell
library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/permutation-0.5.0.5).

It's currently very much a work in progress, but it is a nice example of
something Idris can do that Haskell cannot.

## Installation

```
idris --install permutation.ipkg
