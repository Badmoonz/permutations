# permutations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/permutations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmchale/permutations)

This is a library providing a type-safe implementation of permutations.
To my knowledge, It is the only such library outside of
Coq.

It needs a couple tweaks before it's ready for general use, but everything
*should* be working correctly now.

## Installation

```bash
 $ idris --install permutations.ipkg
```

## Use

### Documentation
