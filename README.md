# permutations

This is a library providing a type-safe implementation of permutations. It
builds on Alyssa Carter's code
[here](https://github.com/trillioneyes/idris-toys/blob/master/Permutation.idr)
and from a [Haskell
library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/permutation-0.5.0.5).

It is currently incomplete, but the functions available should in fact work as
desired.

## Installation

idris --install permutation.ipkg
