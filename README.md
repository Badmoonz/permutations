# permutations

This is a library providing a type-safe implementation of permutations. It
builds on Alyssa Carter's code
[here](https://github.com/trillioneyes/idris-toys/blob/master/Permutation.idr). 

It's currently very much a work in progress, but it is a nice example of
something Idris can do that Haskell cannot where it does work.

## Installation

```
idris --install permutation.ipkg
```
